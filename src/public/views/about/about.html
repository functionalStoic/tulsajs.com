      Why Another Tulsa Dev Meetup?
    </div>
    <p>
      For anyone who has been to the TulsaWebDevs meetups, you may ask why another user group. For you I ask, why not? Some developers may get deterred from a larger group meetup and smaller groups may be more welcoming. In addition Tulsa could use some healthy expanding within the development community.
